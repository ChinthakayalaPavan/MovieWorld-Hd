           <u style="color: red;">Yashoda Movie Review</u> : Samantha 'delivers' a stellar performance <br>
            
Critic's Rating: 
3.5/5
Story: Looking to save her sister, a desperate woman agrees to be a surrogate and move in to a plush facility - but nothing is as it seems.
Review: Survival thrillers are not a new genre but Tollywood does one of them so few and far in between that it's a delight to see- especially when done well. Hari and Hareesh's Yashoda takes a very real-world situation, ups the ante and on top of everything, bank on a dependable actor like Samantha to carry it through.
Yashoda (Samantha Ruth Prabhu) is a surrogate in desperate need of money. Instead of carrying out her pregnancy in the basti she lives in, she is urged to move to the high-end facility Eva, owned by Madhu (Varalaxmi Sarathkumar). It also helps that she has Dr Gowtam (Unni Mukundan), who's easy on the eyes, looking after her health. While the clinically white rooms, pastel outfits, luxurious food and great company seem like a dream-come-true for any pregnant woman, cracks soon form on the surface. A disappearance here, a glitch there and soon Yashoda finds herself unravelling the mystery behind it all.
On the other hand, in the world outside Eva, we also have a murder mystery unravelling. A Hollywood starlet dies under mysterious circumstances, so do a tycoon and a super model. An unknown drug (apart from a fairness cream!) seem to hold the key to the whole mystery. Secret codes, dead policemen, loose ends - how does it all connect to the facility?
The first half of Yashoda banks heavily on comedy and emotion. The scenes where smart-mouthed Yashoda flirts with Gowtam, pulls pranks on the facility workers and banters with the many women like her there makes you chuckle.
