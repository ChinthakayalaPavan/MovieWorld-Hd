            <u style="color: red;">Bajirao Mastani Movie Review</u>:
            Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Mangum-Opus 'Bajirao Mastani' finally arrives. Been in the news for more than a decade, this period piece, fortunately, is worth the wait. Its A Well-Made, Well-Acted Motion-Picture, that holds your attention at most times.

'Bajirao Mastani' narrates the story of the Maratha warrior Peshwa Bajirao I of the Maratha Empire (Ranveer Singh) and his second wife Mastani (Deepika Padukone).

'Bajirao Mastani' is epically mounted & Bhansali has Directed the film with enviable ambition. The scale of the film is something to watch! The visual appeal is tremendous. But, what makes 'Bajirao Mastani' further more memorable, is its human-conflict between its primary characters. The relationship of Bajirao & Mastani is sharp, and even the relationship between Bajirao & his first wife Kashibai (Priyanka Chopra), is compelling. Watching the warrior torn between love, politics & religion, often grabs your attention. I was involved in Bajirao's quest to give his women the respect they deserve, despite the evil-heads who intended to ruin it.

Having said that, 'Bajirao Mastani' isn't without its share of blemishes. While the first-hour is arresting, the second-hour takes a dip & the pace drops. Also, the film overstays its welcome by a good 20-minutes, that certainly needed some trimming. A crisper & sharper second-hour would've only enhanced the overall impact!
