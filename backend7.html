        <h3><u style="color: red;">Pushpaka Vimanam Movie review</u>:
            Pushpaka Vimanam starts as a simple film. It prepares us to be a breezy romantic caper with small differences between a newly-wed couple and the wife abandoning the innocent husband. It shows the woes of the husband, how he is constantly ‘judged’ by his neighbours and his colleagues about his just-started marital life. The story is told from Sundar’s point-of-view. But the interval twist comes as a sudden shock to viewers.

The audiences are not prepared for the dark, gritty mystery that is shown. Simple comic caper slowly transpires into a dark film with the mystery and crime angles laced with it. This is where the film falters. The layers of crime, mystery aren’t well imbibed into the script. After the motive behind the crime is revealed and how the crime took place and thus mystery gets resolved, it looks silly as it doesn’t justify the curiosity it had generated before.

However, there are a handful of scenes in the film which evoke some fun. The police station scene between Rekha (Saanve Megghana) and SI Rangam (Sunil) where the former warns the latter is hilarious. There is another scene where Rekha hides in Naresh’s house during a police search. How she and Sundar manage to escape from the cops generates good laughs. Saanvee, Sunil and Naresh are the saving grace in the film.

The problem with Pushpaka Vimanam is its second-half which isn’t handled well. The investigation portions are not racy. The montage song where Sundar is on run should have been trimmed or totally avoided as it takes off the intensity of the situation which originally requires. The film also leaves some unanswered questions to viewers. How will a newly-married husband love his ‘eloped’ wife so much even after she rejected him? Why is he so desperate about her? Also why a best friend (Saranya) doesn’t even approach police even after knowing her friend Meenakshi’s murder? How did the culprit shift the deceased’s body to the crime spot escaping from cameras and people? Why did the constable try to help Sundar? These are some loose ends in this dark comedy.
