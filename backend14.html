            <u style="color: red;">Salute Movie Review</u>:
            For the first hour, it would seem like director Rosshan Andrews and writers Bobby-Sanjay have given us one of the most edge-of-seat thrillers in recent times, with a unique investigation story that is driven and made compelling with issues of ethics, corruption, power and a toxic family relationship. But surprisingly, when it comes down to the investigation itself in the latter half, it becomes quite mundane and stretches on for too long, with a resolution that seems to defeat the purpose of the protagonistâ€™s principled stand.

            The film starts with SI Aravind Karunakaran, played by Dulquer Salmaan, returning to his old station while he is on his long leave seeking the files of a murder and rash driving cases. The story soon goes into flashback, showing that Aravind was on the team, led by his adored, older brother DySP Ajith (Manoj K Jayan) investigating the murder. With an election looming, there is intense political pressure on the police to solve it, leading them to plant evidence and implicate an innocent.
