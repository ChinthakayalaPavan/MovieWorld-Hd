        <h3>
            <u style="color: red;">Dhamaka Movie Review</u>:
            
Whilst, on the one hand, Dhamaka strongly stands against the shenanigans of News Publications, by giving us a tiny specimen of their toxic work cultures. On the other hand, it blatantly discloses the two-faced nature of these so-called media houses through their scandalous & unctuous operations.

The narrative here makes an exhibition for all the selfish agendas of all those insatiable individuals who do not look after the common citizens nor they want to bear any sort of responsibility towards our nation's welfare; all they care about is wealth and of course their superficial rating systems!

If only the makers had given the same amount of attention and care to the remainder of the film, trust me; this could have been something else entirely! Sadly, that didn't come to pass and I for one blame the Characterization more than anything else here! And yeah one more thing, hate me all you want but, to tell the truth, Kartik Aryan didn't come across as the best choice in there.

Frankly speaking, I didn't like his portrayal! I hardly managed to connect to him on a personal level, therefore the majority of the sentimental aspects failed to make an impact on me! Don't get me wrong, I'm not at all discrediting Kartik for his honourable attempt here but gotta admit, despite his genuine efforts, his rather caricaturish depiction of an egoistic News commentator just didn't seem like the fairest outcome for such a complex character!
