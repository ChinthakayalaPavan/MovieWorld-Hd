           <h3> <u style="color: red;"> Adbhutham Telugu Movie Review </u>- Harmless Watch on a weekend!
Surya (Teja Sajja) and Vennela (Shivani Rajasekhar) make the decision to commit suicide. Their cell phones shift their course just as they're about to commit themselves. All of this occurs because they share the same phone number yet are unable to meet. The rest of the novel is made up of the succession of events that occur in their lives as a result of it. 


Teja Sajja made his cinematic debut with Adbhutham. He started the project before Oh Baby, but it was postponed for a variety of reasons. He has delivered a competent performance. In simple scenarios, he's fine, but in emotional scenes, he's uncomfortable. But, given that it is his debut film, they are still good.


The plot of Adbhutham is identical to that of the film Playback (2020). We can't determine which came first, the egg or the chicken, because Adbhutham is a delayed film. The plot revolves around two people from various timelines conversing on the phone. There's a scientist character who gives an explanation, but it's terrible. That, however, is not Adbhutham's issue. 


The director Malik ram chose the Time Travel (?) theme as a unique and interesting subject. But then he utilised it to spin a twist on a love narrative. We normally expect the director to take the film down a less-traveled path. However, the film is mostly about a love storey set against the backdrop of time travel.


Surya and Vennela's difficulties are the focus of the first half. However, they do not appear to be convincing enough to cause suicide. The reasons aren't well established, thus they don't appear to be serious. The premise of time travel will be accompanied by some cinematic liberties. However, it leads to a dull love storey that is a show-stopper. Furthermore, the time difference between the two timelines is only five years, allowing the love tale to continue. That is a blunder. 


With a longer time interval, there would have been more interest as the seasons changed. Despite several flaws, the first half of the film is watchable. However, the second half has more problems due to too many dull moments. However, the second half has more problems due to too many dull moments. The last scenes are so long that it feels like the movie is going on forever. The film is easily 20 minutes longer than we would expect from a film of its genre. Shivani Rajasekhar makes her feature film debut with this film. She's OK in non-emotional moments but struggles in emotional ones. satya is regarded as the hero's right-hand man. His comedy is generally a flop, but it does work in a few spots. The discussions worked in some places and not in others. The runtime is excessive, and it is a major problem, particularly in the latter half of the second half.
