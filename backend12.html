            Maaran Review: Dhanush Is Surprisingly Inert In Bland Film
Maaran Review: Film still of Dhanush


3
Cast: Dhanush, Malavika Mohanan, Samuthirakani, Smruthi Venkat, Ramki
Director: Karthick Naren

Rating: 2 stars (out of 5)

Dhanush's third straight direct-to-OTT platform release is a listless crime thriller that even the otherwise dependable actor can do little to salvage. Maaran, written and directed by Karthick Naren and streaming on Disney+Hotstar, is a muddled mish-mash of generic tropes that simply do not add up to a cohesive whole.

Dhanush, whose Jagame Thandhiram and Atrangi Re bypassed the theatres last year and landed on streaming platforms without making any waves, is surprisingly inert in Maaran. Unlike the makers of the film, the actor appears to be perfectly cognizant of the futility of the exercise and thinks the better of investing overt effort in the role.

That is not to suggest that Dhanush sleepwalks through the film. There are junctures at which he does spring to a modicum of life, but the film as a whole never does. It begins bland and stays bland. Hobbled by a screenplay that lacks polish, Maaran fails to gets its act together and flounders through a jumble of laboured twists that are meant to catch the audience by surprise. The surprises that Maaran springs are anything but pleasant
