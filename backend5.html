           <u style="color: red;"> Free Guy Movie Review</u> A delightfully entertaining Ryan Reynolds vehicle. <br>

<u>Critic's Rating</u> 
4.0/5. <br>
Free Guy Story: Unaware that he’s a non-playable character or NPC in a game, Guy (Ryan Reynolds) has bigger dreams than he is programmed for.
Free Guy Review: Waking up in a comfy apartment, getting his favourite coffee, going to work at the bank with his buddy, and getting robbed by some goons is just a typical day for Guy (Ryan Reynolds). Totally oblivious that he’s just a character in a video game, a chance encounter compels Guy to break his routine and challenge the rules of his world.
Since it is primarily set within a game, ‘Free Guy’ has the perfect playground for physics-defying action and narrative freedom where the rules can change along the way. The real-life personas of its human players often contrast their online avatars, evident as Jodie Comer and Joe Keery change characteristics when in and out of the game. But Comer is particularly captivating with two distinct personalities in each realm, effortlessly switching accents and body language. She continues to demonstrate immense movie-star potential with her remarkable prowess. Taika Waititi is well-suited as the fast-talking and scheming antagonistic game developer. Amidst all the wonderfully rendered video-game visuals and effects, keep an eye out for numerous Easter eggs and celebrity cameos.
Even though ‘Free Guy’ touches on artificial intelligence with commentaries on gamer culture, director Shawn Levy ensures the tonality never gets too preachy. Staying well within popcorn entertainer boundaries, the film is self-aware and doesn’t take itself too seriously, just like Ryan Reynolds. That said, ‘Free Guy’ is an unabashed showcase of his onscreen talents. Ever since his role as Deadpool, there’s a specific blend of comedy and action we’ve come to expect from his films. ‘Free Guy’ has a premise tailor-made to his brand, and the bankable star has a blast with it. Filled with satisfying gags and dazzling action mixed with a dash of warmth, this is a highly enjoyable movie that makes the most of its cast and leading man, in particular.
